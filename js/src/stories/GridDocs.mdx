# Cards in grids and their filling behavior

All the card examples in this page have the same height as imposed by their containing element.

## Simple

```
grid(
  card(
    h3("Foo"),
    plot()
  ),
  card(
    h3("Bar"),
    plot(height=150)
  ),
  card(
    h3("Baz"),
    plot(height=225)
  ),
  nCols=3
)
```

<Story of={GridStories.a} />

## Breaking out of height of row

A card can be stopped from stretching to fill the container it is in if it is given a height of `"content"` or a numeric value representing pixel size can also be provided.

```
grid(
  card(
    h3("Foo"),
    plot()
  ),
  card(
    h3("Bar"),
    plot(height=150),
    height="content"
  ),
  card(
    h3("Baz"),
    plot(height=225),
    height=400
  ),
  nCols=3
)
```

<Story of={GridStories.b} />

`"content"` is used due to it matching the [property used in flexbox itself to acheive this behavior.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-basis#syntax)
