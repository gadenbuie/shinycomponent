## Colors

We have a small set of colors that are used for theming. The following are the colors and where they should be used.

### `brand`

This is typically a colorful color. It should be used for actionable items. E.g. a button that can be pressed. It should not be used for text or backgrounds.

### `text-1`

This is the typical text color. It should be used for things like headers and primary text.

### `text-2`

This is the secondary text color. It is typically a little less contrasty to deemphasize it. It should be used for text that is not critical to the main action and thus doesn't need to be as prominent.

### `surface-1`

This is the primary background color. It will have the greatest contrast with the text colors and is typically usesd for things like backgrounds of a full app etc..

### `surface-{2,3}`

These is a secondary background colors. Their contrast is alittle softer than `surface-1` but it is still very legible. This will often be used for things like cards etc.

### `surface-4`

This is a relatively low contrast background color. It should be used for contents that have large text or icons so the contrast is still acceptable. It's useful for creating a hierarchy of information and things like headers and footers for cards etc..

### `success`

This is most often a shade of green. It should be used almost exclusively for success messages.

### `warning`

Often a shade of orange. Like `success` it should be used almost exclusively for warning messages.

### `error`

Often a shade of red. Like `success` it should be used almost exclusively for error messages.
